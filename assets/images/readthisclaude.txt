About issue 2, on reviews, HOW DOES A CUSTOMER EVEN PUT A
 REVIEW ANYWHERE? 
theres probably no way he can do it fron his frontend.

goin back t the navbar padding fix, all you did is increase the
 internal padding between each navbar element. I want the whole group
 of nav elements- home myfarm about etc etc, to be as a group, 
 separatd from the logo and the Cart.
